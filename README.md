## MAGD150Projects

#### Lab 1: _Static Composition in Black/White_
  I made just a basic house. Since we didn't know how to make triangles at that moment, I used lines to create one for the roof. I also made the windows look more realistic by filling it in to look like it was shining inside the house.
  
#### Lab 2: _Color Composition_
  Creating the satallite was the most challenging thing to create with this project. I Have 3 planets just folating in the air, they are neptune, mars, and the moon. The black dots are suppose to represent stars.
  
#### Lab 3: _Math_
  In order to get the full bubble effect, I set a low frame rate of 5. I have one bubble following the mouse, 3 bubbles moving in the y-direction, and 3 bubbles moving in the x direction. Moving the curser fast enough with this low frame rate is what allows for the full effect.
  
#### Lab 4: _Dynamism_
  The pizza looks appetizing with all thoe toppings lurking around it. Hover the curser over the pizza to go from the pepperoni topping to the sausage topping. click the mouse to find the green peppers and press the space bar to find the mushrooms. mover the curser up and down to reveal bbq sauce and red pepper, and move the curser left and right to reveal banana peppers and ranch sauce.
  
#### Lab 6: _Organization_
  Getting to create one of my favoritve retro games was a ton of fun. Drawing Pacman was a little challenging at first, but as soon as I got the right angles, I was satisfied. I Decided to make it interactive so that it felt like you were playing a spin-off version of pacman. The goal of this game was to get through the maze without hitting any walls and collecting all the tic-tacs
